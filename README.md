# my-summer-in-markdown
## Introduction
My name is **Jannat Afridi** and I am in 12th grade. I have two younger brothers, one is a sophomore and the other is in 4th grade. I love spedning time with my mom, we do everything together. I enjoy hiking, eating, and watching shows on Netflix. 

## Summer Activities
Over the summer, I did not really do much. I just wanted to relax after a hectic junior year. I went to the beach, multiples times, with my family. We also went camping at Kern River. I reconnected with some of my friends from elementary school and we went shopping at the mall. Other than that, my summer was pretty uneventful.
